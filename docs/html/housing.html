    <div class="text">
      <p><span class="first-word">48</span> hours after <strong>Emma*</strong> is discharged from a year long stay in a mental health hospital, she is homeless.</p>
      <p>In the twelve months before she was in a hospital outside her city, focusing on her mental health and recovery.</p>
      <p>She knows that coming back to the place she lived before to start a new life would not be easy.</p>
      <p>But she does not know that her new housemate would ask her to leave after just two days.</p>
      <p>"My mental health needs were too complex for her to have me living in the house", Emma says.</p>
      <p>She found the house when she was still in hospital - and already expected that, because of her needs, it would not be the ideal place. But running out of time and options she didn't have another choice.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"I had worked really, really hard that year in hospital to turn my life around. I hadn't expected to come back and not even have a roof over my head."<br><div class="source">Emma</div></blockquote>
      <p>There are basic needs that should be met for everyone - food, water, warmth, and rest. After the physiological needs come security and safety.</p>
      <p>"We all want somewhere safe to live", is how <strong>Claire Terrington</strong> sums it up. She is an <strong>occupational therapist</strong> working in the <strong>Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust</strong>.</p>
      <p>When Emma is discharged from hospital, her basic needs are not met.</p>
      <p>For the next three years, Emma is on and off homeless. Moving between unsuitable accommodation, trying to find something permanent to stay. While trying to recover from something that was severe enough to land her in hospital.</p>
      <p>Emma is not an isolated case. In February 2021, <strong>over XXX people</strong> who were in contact with mental health services experienced some kind of homelessness.</p>
      <p>Homelessness has many faces. It can be sleeping rough, sofa surfing, living in homelessness hostels or in temporary accommodation. It is what the name implies: not having a home.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <div class="text">
      <p>Last year over XXX people in England spent time in hospital/ were admitted to hospital for a mental health problem.</p>
      <p>According to Mind's housing report Brick by Brick, experiencing a mental health crisis / a hospital admission can lead to someone losing their home.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"Admission and discharge from hospital are key housing transitions for people experiencing mental health problems. The period after hospital discharge is high risk for a first or recurrent period of homelessness."<br><div class="source">Mind, Brick by Brick</div></blockquote>
      <p>To mitigate risks of homelessness discharge planning should start as soon as someone is admitted to hospital.</p>
      <p>"What we need to do as service is to think about discharge planning from day one of admission," says Claire Terrington.</p>
      <p><strong>NICE guideline</strong> states that the discharge planning should be collaborative, person-centred and suitably-paced. In order to do so, the inpatient team should work with the community mental health team, the patient and their family, carers or advocate.</p>

      <h3>The lack of housing professionals in inpatient settings</h3>
      <p>What happens when someone is in hospital and does not have housing?</p>
      <p>"It's a huge issue", says Claire Terrington. More than anything, the patients need support in finding a home.</p>
      <p>But the minority of trusts have dedicated housing professionals in their discharge teams, data obtained through Freedom of Information requests shows. Out of X trusts, only X have one or more housing support workers in their inpatient teams.</p>
      <p>hospital discharge homeless fund</p>
      <p>When there isn't a dedicated housing professional, it comes down to the nurses to identify housing issues on admission. They then have to/should work with the community care co-ordinator, local authority or housing department to secure housing.</p>
      <p>The quality of the support the patient gets depends on how good their team is at finding accommodation.</p>
      <p>More experience with finding accommodation results in better outcomes, finds Claire Terrington. Over the years, she has been able to build up a network with housing providers in Birmingham.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"If you're clever and you've been around a bit like me you keep a list of places that are really good and you keep on contacting those people and you keep them on your good side. So if they got a vacancy, they'll phone you and say they've got a vacancy."<br><div class="source">Claire Terrington</div></blockquote>
      <p>But no matter how good a team is at finding work, they cannot replace housing officers. When Claire Terrington worked in assertive outreach services - a …</p>
      <p>Her team had a dedicated housing officer who knew everything there was to know about housing issues, housing laws, and the rights of patients.</p>
      <p>ADD QUOTE</p>
      <p>Added to that, they often have high case loads and need to take care of …, not only housing.</p>

      <h3>(Mis)communication</h3>
      <p>When different teams have to work together to support someone with housing, the outcome also depends on how well they communicate with each other.</p>
      <p>Before Emma's discharge, her team in the hospital tried to arrange a meeting with her community team back home. But her community team either cancelled meetings or just did not show up. In the end, they had to drive to the city one hour and a half away, piling in the car.</p>
      <p>"We literally had to turn up and say 'you need to meet about this service user that's about to come back to your area'. It was really difficult", Emma remembers.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"The two sides communicating was impossible."</blockquote>
      <p>Because of the communication problems Emma's team wasn't fully aware that she was facing homelessness.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"But if they would have listened, if they would have communicated with us, then they would have known and would have had more time to help me out."<br><div class="source">Emma</div></blockquote>

      <h3>Risk and lack of accommodation</h3>
      <p>Having lost a home, it is hard to find a new one. Risk and a lack of accommodation limit available choices.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"Accommodation is massively important, but there is a huge gap. There aren't enough one-bedroom flats and there isn't enough supported accommodation either. <br>"We don't have enough housing for people regardless of needs. It just isn't enough housing. We are overrun by people."<br><div class="source">Claire Terrington</div></blockquote>
      <p>When Emma is looking for accommodation she is often told that waitings lists are long, that there is nothing else to be done.</p>
      <p>Less range means also less to choose from, less accommodation that is suitable, that meets the patient's needs.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"There's a dearth of accommodation out there and that makes it less likely that any particular place is going to be good enough for an individual."<br><div class="source">Nuwan Dissanayaka</div></blockquote>
      <p>Added to that is a huge competition for actually available and suitable housing.</p>
      <p>And those who have a level of risk associated with their illness are often excluded from accommodation because of it, says Dissanayaka.</p>
      <p>"Some people engage in really risky things before they are brought into hospital. And once that gets put on paper it's really hard to find them somewhere to live", Claire Terrington says.</p>

      <h3>Delayed discharges</h3>
      <p>Not having housing in place after discharge can sometimes lead to patients staying in hospital longer than they need to for the treatment of their illness. This is called delayed discharge.</p>
      <p>Claire knows that services try not to send anyone home without having suitable accommodation. "This is why we end up with people in hospital for longer. It's a real lengthy process to find anywhere - if we can find anywhere", she says.</p>
      <p>In January 2021, there were <strong>17,512 days of delayed discharge</strong>. 40% less than one year before. This means, every day on average <strong>565 patients</strong> spent additional time in hospital.</p>

      <!-- article continues -->
      <p>Out of all the extra days that patients have spent in hospital because of housing needs, waiting for supported accommodation is the main reason.</p>
      <p>Sometimes there isn't a solution to the accommodation problem, says Dissanayaka. And when people no longer need to be in hospital for treatment of their illness, then there is a pressure to discharge them into the community.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"I think it is a very difficult decision, most difficult for the patient at the centre of it but those decisions are made sometimes because I guess services don't feel they have any other option but to do that." <br><div class="source">Nuwan Dissanayaka</div></blockquote>

      <h3>Delayed discharges: negative sides / to be reduced</h3>
      <p>Delayed discharges negatively impact the finances and performance of the health and care system.</p>
      <p>Delays in discharging patients affects the flow of patients through a hospital. Patients staying in hospital longer than they need to be means new patients cannot be admitted - because there aren't enough beds available.</p>
      <p>BED OCCUPANCY DATA: Mental health units across England are experiencing extreme bed pressures - not only since the Covid-19 pandemic. In X 2021, on average X% of hospital beds were occupied by mental health patients.</p>
      <p>DEMAND IN MH SERVICES RISING</p>
      <p>Sometimes patients are medically fit to be discharged and can't be kept in hospital longer although they don't have suitable housing.</p>

      <h3>From hospital to hostel</h3>
      <p>When Lily* was 20, she was discharged into a hostel.</p>
      <p>After staying in an acute ward for seven weeks, she was deemed well enough to go home - only that she did not have a home.</p>
      <p>"There was no real option about where to house me at that point", she says. Before her admission, she became estranged from her family and friends. Living with them wasn't possible.</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"And then there was an idea that if I declared myself as homeless and stayed in a hostel that I would have quicker access to community housing. It was sold to me as the best and quickest way of alerting people to my homelessness and the severity of my situation."<br><div class="source">Lily</div></blockquote>
      <p>Before Lily went to hospital, she slept rough for a few weeks, was often around people who were struggling with their mental health and substance misuse. Facing a similar environment again, frightened her.</p>
      <p>Hostels are there to provide essential, emergency accommodation for people who are homeless, Mind say in their report Brick by Brick. They should come with key workers and referral routes to some form of psychological support. But they also say: "High demand and funding pressures limit the support options available."</p>
      <p>Claire Terrington knows what staying in a hostel is like. Some of her patients have been placed in a hostel. (sentence about crying?)</p>
      <blockquote class="quote">"They're not pleasant places. They are often full of people who are drunk, using substances, noisy at night. You wouldn't feel safe and secure there at all."</blockquote>
      <p>Lily stayed in the hostel for a week. She describes the environment as frightening, having a substantial impact on her mental health.</p>
      <p>She says: "It was troubling to be there."</p>
      <p>She was readmitted to hospital. Luckily not for long. Instead of going back to the hostel, she could stay with a distant (other word?) family member.</p>
      <p>Six weeks after declaring herself homeless, Lily was given a council property.</p>
      <p>Today she looks back at it. And although the hostel was the quickest way of of accessing social housing, she wouldn't have done it if there would have been other options.</p>
